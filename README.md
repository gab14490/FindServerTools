# FindServerTools
Tools create to help finding your things on the networks

Hello everyone 
Everything i will post on github if its said will be totally free
You can use my code for any purpose 

If you find something that you want to change tell me and help the tools to be better :)

I currently use customtkinter for a better visual 

for the code, simply enter the default host name or your own in the input field and it will look up the IP address across the network.

Have a nice day .
GaB
